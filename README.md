# VSDNASSCOM-Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning
This repository captures the work from a 5-day hands-on workshop on Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning, conducted by VSD Corp using open-source tools and the Google SkyWater 130 nm PDK. The workshop focuses on the complete flow from RTL to GDSII, leveraging tools such as OpenLANE, Magic, Ngspice, and TritonRoute.
All screenshots of the completed labs are available in the master branch.
